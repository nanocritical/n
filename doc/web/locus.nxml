      <h2|Locus

      <p|A locus is an opaque type that indexes an element in a container.
      <p|A locus is to an index what a C++ iterator is to a pointer.
      <p|A random access locus would have to be <code|comparable>,
        <code|ordered>, and implement at least <code|additive_arithmetic>.
        Instead of introducing such a new type, N restricts
        <code|random_container>s to use <code|size> as locus type.
